# An 8-bit computer implemented in FPGA

This is an 8-bit computer implemented using Verilog

This computer can perform addition and subtraction on integers

We can program this computer using the [program.bin](program.bin) file

To understand how the computer works, reference [doc.md](/docs/doc.md)

Simulation (done with [GTKWave](https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/)):
